# MuscleHub-AB-Test
Conducting A/B Test with Chi Square Test 

The hypothetical gym, MuscleHub, wants to gather some information re: the membership and application processes. At MuscleHub, some patrons are given a fitness test (Group A) to obtain more information about the potential gym customers. Group B patrons were not given a fitness test. 

This project examined the following:
- Percent of visitors who apply
- Percent of applicants who purchase a membership
- Percent of visitors who purchase a membership

Our goal is to determine which factors have a statistical significance in the membership and application rates. 

This project is selected from the "Analyze Data with Python" course on Codecademy.com.
